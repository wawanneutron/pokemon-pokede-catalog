## Technical Decisions

- **Next.js App Router** was chosen for flexible routing and server/client components.
- **React Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`) was used for data fetching, caching, and background updates.
- **Material UI (MUI)** provided a clean and customizable UI component system.
- **PokeAPI** serves as the data source for all Pokémon-related info.
- **Session Storage** is used for temporary state persistence (e.g., welcome modal).
- **Pagination logic** was encapsulated into a custom `usePagination` hook for reuse.
